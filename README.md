# WiDucky
WiFi Enabled USB Rubber Ducky

An Arduino and ESP8266 based USB Rubber Ducky fashioned on the HAK5 Rubber Ducky Module.

This device allows keystrokes to be sent via WiFi to a target machine. The target recognises the Ducky as both a standard HID keyboard and a serial port, allows interactive commands and scripts to be executed on the target remotely.

The software can be used via the Cactus Micro v2 Arduino Board, or theres a version for an Arduino connected 
to a ESP-12E module for those who wish to build thier own hardware.
