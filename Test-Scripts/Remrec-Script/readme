This command batch file allows feedback from the target Windows machine to be sent.
If the Widucky types 'remrec4.bat dir/w', the batch file executes the the 'dir/w' command 
and sends the output of the command to the WiDucky serial port. 
The output is then returned via wifi to the controller application and displayed remotely.
(*This requires the Arduino drivers to be loaded on the target machine.)
