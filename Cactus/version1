Steps Required:

1. Loading the 'Programmer.ino' into the Arduino chip on the Cactus board.
2. Use the Cactus as a programmer itself to load up the ESP8266 generic.bin firmware into the ESP8266 chip
   (You can also use a flasher exe to do this - google 'ESP8266 Flasher' if you wish.)
3. Once firmware upload verified, use Arduino IDE to flash the 'Widuck_cactus4.ino' into the Arduino of the Cactus board.

4. You should now see a wifi access point called 'WiDucky' and its password is 'quackings'

5. You need one of the Controller applications to talk to the duck.
