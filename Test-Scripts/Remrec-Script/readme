This command batch file allows feedback from the target Windows machine to be sent.
The Widucky types 'remrec4.bat dir/w, and the batch file executes the the dir/w command 
and sends the output of the command to the widucky serial port. 
The output is then returned via wifi to the controller application and displayed.
(*This requires the Arduino drivers to be loaded on the target machine.)
